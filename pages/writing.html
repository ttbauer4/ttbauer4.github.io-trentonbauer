            <p>Swiping through reels, I was met with an all-too-familiar video telling me that I should quit my job and travel the world. Rebuking me was a pretty 20-something girl swimming in what I assumed to be the Mediterranean, backdropped by a gorgeous sunset. Scrolling is an incredibly unfeeling activity most of the time, but for some reason this video sparked some emotion in me. At first it was anger that I am of the generation which heralds this perspective. Next was probably some jealousy. Finally, I felt disheartened at how screwed up our world is. Then I kept scrolling.</p>
            <p>The sort of content which encourages the rejection of the "rat race" has been covered extensively, so it's unlikely I can offer a novel perspective on the matter. I also acknowledge that me criticizing  privileged Gen Zers is a little like the pot calling the kettle black. What I really aim to create is an ode to the "rat race" and hopefully convince some folks that life ain't that bad.</p>
            <p>Humans have been specialized creatures since the dawn of civilization. As we moved from hunter-gatherer societies into more tightly-knit communities which would evolve to become cities as we know them today, people found their niches. Our food, water, and shelter needs could now be met more efficiently, increasing the ratio of sustinence output to people working on producing it (i.e., one farmer producing food for many individuals). No longer was a person's entire existence spent surviving-- we could trade our time spent working on our specialty (as a potter, blacksmith, factory worker, or computer programmer) for our basic necessities.</p>
            <p>I need to interject here to provide some clarification. I know that this is a massive oversimplification. I write this piece $20000 in debt, unsure of what the next year will hold. I'm scared, but I am lucky enough to think it'll probably work out. Tomorrow isn't promised for any of us, but it's even less assured for some. This is not intended to be a dismissal or trivialization of the financial and social struggles that so many Americans face on a daily basis. Rather, it is an addressal of the angst shared by many of my socioeconomic peers, the same angst expressed by the  "quit your job and travel" girl I mentioned previously. It's an encouragement of gratitude, not an ignorant rant. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>quitting your job to travel is taking advantage of those who are working</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>It's a very old head thing to say "we can’t all just not work," but it's true</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>There are a lot of ways to make oneself valuable these days. I find a lot of comfort in that, even if it means 45 years of 9 to 5.</p>
