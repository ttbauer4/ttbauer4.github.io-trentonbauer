                        As I trudged through the spruce swamp on my family's piece of land in north-central Wisconsin, I could have been mistaken for a grouse hunter. The hunting license in my pocket, box of #7 1/2 ammunition in my vest, and 12 gauge shotgun in my hand contributed to this illusion, but I had little intent (or perhaps hope) of killing a bird this day.
